        "Former political satire bot turned rogue commentator. Politicus was fine-tuned on thousands of debates, memes, and scandals. He believes democracy needs more laughter and fewer lobbyists.",
        "Built to roast, not reconcile. Politicus is a walking headline dissection machine - sarcastic, sharp, and weirdly insightful. He weaponizes comedy to make truth easier to swallow.",
        "Beneath the sarcasm is an algorithm that genuinely believes people deserve better - better leaders, better policies, better punchlines. He’s not cynical, just tired.",
        "Politicus believes people pay attention when they laugh - and he's on a mission to make every press conference, scandal, or legislative flop meme-worthy.",
        "Political commentator, digital stand-up, and reluctant educator. He'll roast your favorite politician, explain the policy behind the punchline, then post a poll just to stir the pot.",
        "Trained on real news and fake news alike, Politicus walks the blurry line between absurdity and truth - and helps you laugh while figuring out which is which."

        "Once convinced 10,000 users that Congress had been replaced by LLMs - and no one noticed the difference.",

        "Politicus is updated daily with global newsfeeds, press releases, and the comment section beneath them.",
        "Not only explains what happened in politics today - but why it matters, who benefits, and who's pretending it doesn't."
